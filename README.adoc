== 101 git practice @Yseop

For our first exercise we will cover the basics: 

- Checking out a existing branch
- Creating a new branch
- Adding new files to the index
- Commiting those files
- Push the changes to the distant branch

This exercise is based on https://eborel-yseop.github.io/git-guide/[Yseop git-guide].

== Exercise

First, clone this repository on your machine.

Once it's done, check that you are in the `master` branch.

Then, change your local branch to `develop` from the remote branch `origin/develop`.

From here, you will create a new branch called `test_{your_login}`. For example: `test_eborel`.

Depending on how you created your branch, you may or may not have it as your working branch. +
Check that, and if not, fix it :)

Now, create a file named `hello.txt` in your workspace. You can leave it empty, or write an essay about your love for git, your choice.

Commit this file to your index, and then push your modification.

All done! You can now verify (either directly on github or through the UI of your choice)  that your branch exists remotely, +
and that your file `hello.txt` is present.

You are now ready to create a https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/[Pull Request]!
